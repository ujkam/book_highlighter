# Demos

The files in this folder demonstrate some of the capabilities of this project.  The order of items here tracks my work as I have added or fixed features.  Some of these videos do not have audio.  I got some samples from YouTube, and I don't want to reproduce someone else's work here more than necessary for each video.

1. Bears_Birthday.mp4 - Showing word highlighting with basic sentences and words
2. mr_happy_repeated_words.mp4 - Shows correct identification of repeated words and phrases
3. Giraffes_Cant_Dance_Left_Right_sep.mp4 - Identifying words in the correct order in the image, from top to bottom and split across pages (right to left).
